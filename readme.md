# Electricity Consumption Prediction using LSTM

![Electricity Consumption](https://github.com/ghostridersahil/ElectricityConsumption_using_LSTM/blob/master/energies-13-02672-ag.jpg)

## Introduction

This repository contains code for predicting electricity consumption using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks implemented with TensorFlow. The dataset used for training and testing has dimensions of 2 million rows and 10 columns.

## About LSTM

LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is particularly effective for modeling sequences and time-series data. They are capable of learning long-term dependencies and are well-suited for predicting future values based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of 2 million data points with 10 features related to electricity consumption. It includes historical records of electricity usage over time.

## Implementation

The code in this repository demonstrates how to preprocess the data, build an LSTM model using TensorFlow, train the model on the dataset, and evaluate its performance. Additionally, it provides functionality for making predictions on new data.

## Getting Started

To get started with using this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
